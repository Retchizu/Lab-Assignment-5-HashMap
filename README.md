# INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
1. You are not allowed to alter the composition of the domain objects.  Stick to the design. Disregard the data in the csv if it is not necessary to the object. <br>
2. Adhere to correct naming conventions in naming variables and objects.<br>
3. Use hashmap as your solution to the problem. <br>
4. Use the department.setDepTotalSalary() in putting the aggregated value into the object.  Do not just use the salary accumulation approach in the printing process to get the depTotalSalary.<br>
5. Submit the Github solution link provided in NEUVLE. <br>
